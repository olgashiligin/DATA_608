Project Proposal

The purpose of the project is to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally.

The following steps will be taken to analyse the suicide rate and possible reasons of it:

- suicide rate by countries;
- changes of suicide rate over time (peak years, countries with increasing/decreasing suicide rate):
- typical suicide profile (age, gender, generation);
- correlation of suicide rate and GDP;

This analysis can be useful in developing suicide prevention measures.
